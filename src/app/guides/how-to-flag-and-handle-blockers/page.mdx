# How to Flag and Handle Blockers

## A Guide to Getting Things Moving Again

Every project hits bumps. But not every bump is a blocker. Knowing **when** to raise your hand — and **how** — is a critical skill. It keeps things flowing, avoids hidden delays, and builds trust across the team.

---

## So… What _Is_ a Blocker?

Not everything annoying is a blocker. A real blocker is when:

- You literally **can’t proceed** without something or someone
- You’re **waiting** on a decision, answer, or dependency
- A bug, access issue, or broken flow has **halted progress**

If you’re just _uncertain_ how to proceed — that’s not a blocker. That’s a **question** (which is also fine to ask!).

---

## How to Spot It Early

A blocker often starts as:

- “Hmm… this is taking longer than I thought.”
- “I’ve pinged them twice, no reply yet.”
- “I’m not sure what I’m waiting for anymore.”

If your gut says _“I’m spinning”_ — that’s a blocker trying to get your attention.

## Don’t Wait for the Standup

Flag blockers **as soon as you notice them** — not the next day, not “I’ll see if it resolves.” The earlier the signal, the easier the fix. Use team chat, issue comments, or a quick DM. You’re not being annoying — you’re being **responsible**.

---

## How to Say It Clearly

Here’s a simple format that gets results:

> “I’m blocked on X — I need Y from Z to move forward.  
> I’ve already tried A and B. Let me know how to proceed.”

Short. Specific. Actionable.

---

## Who Do You Tell?

Start with the person who owns the thing. If no response:

1. Follow up once — clearly and respectfully.
2. Still stuck? Flag it to your PM / lead / project channel.
3. Still no motion? Time to **escalate**.

Escalation ≠ drama. It means **unblocking the team** when the usual routes don’t work.

---

## Tracking Helps

If your team uses a tracker (like Jira, Linear, Notion) — make blockers visible. Add a tag, comment, or status. This makes sure they don’t fall through the cracks and lets leads prioritize fixes.

---

## Reminder: Raising Blockers = Leadership

Flagging blockers isn’t a sign of failure. It’s how teams **move fast without burning out**. If no one speaks up, issues go invisible — and that’s when things really go wrong. So speak up early, clearly, and calmly. You’re not just unblocking yourself — you’re protecting the team.
