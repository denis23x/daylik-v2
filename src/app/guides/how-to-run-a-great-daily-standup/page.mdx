# How to Run a Great Daily Standup

## A Guide for Facilitators

A standup isn’t a meeting. It’s a **sync**. The goal is to align, surface blockers, and keep everyone focused — **not** to solve problems or dive into long discussions.

Here’s a guide for leading standups that are short, useful, and energizing:

---

## Basic Format (The Classic 3):

Each person answers:

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What are you working on today?
3. Any blockers?

You can simplify to just:

- What’s done?
- What’s in the way?

Keep answers **short and focused** — no bug deep-dives or side stories.

---

## Timing & Flow:

Keep it under **15 minutes** — short and sharp. Start **on time**, even if someone’s late — you’re setting the rhythm. Don’t let it turn into a status report. Keep things light, energetic, and human. Calling on people in **random order** helps keep attention up. And remember: this is about updates and blockers — not solving the entire sprint. Take deeper dives offline.

---

## Why Atmosphere Matters (A Bit of Psychology):

People mirror energy. If the standup feels tense, performative, or dull — that spreads. But if it feels relaxed, respectful, and a bit fun, people engage more naturally. Random order keeps attention active. A light tone reduces anxiety. And a short, clear structure builds trust — everyone knows what to expect and that their time won’t be wasted.

---

## If Someone Goes Too Deep:

Sometimes someone starts telling a full story — context, details, side quests. You’ve been there. It’s natural, but that’s where you step in. As facilitator, it’s your job to **gently steer things back**. Try:

> “Let’s take this topic right after the standup.”  
> “Sounds important — can you sync up with X after this?”  
> “Let’s keep moving and circle back if needed.”

You’re not cutting them off — you’re **protecting everyone’s time**.

---

## When There's a Blocker:

If someone brings up a blocker, pause for a second.

Ask: “Do you need help or just visibility?”\
If it needs solving, suggest: “Can you and X sync right after?”

Don’t try to fix it in the standup. Just **note it down**, and make sure it’s tracked in a chat or board so it doesn’t fall through the cracks.

---

## A Note on Team Psychology:

Standups also serve a subtle purpose: building a sense of safety and progress. When people feel heard regularly — even for 20 seconds a day — it creates consistency, accountability, and trust. Avoid treating it like a daily check-in with a manager. Think of it as a team checking in _with each other_.

---

## Common Pitfalls:

The format seems simple — and it is — but it’s easy to get off track. Here are the patterns to watch out for:

- Turns into a mini-meeting or status report
- One person monologues while others zone out
- People forget to mention blockers or say “all good” by default
- No clear structure, feels random

---

Being a facilitator doesn’t mean being the boss. It means being the **guardian of focus, rhythm, and team energy**. A good standup is short, sharp, and keeps the team in sync — **not sleepy**.
